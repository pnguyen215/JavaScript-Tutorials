The JavaScript Map object is used to map keys to values. It stores each element as key-value pair. It operates the elements such as search, update and delete on the basis of specified key.
Syntax

A map object can contain the duplicate values.
The key and value can be of any type (allows both object and primitive values).
A map object iterates its elements in insertion order.
